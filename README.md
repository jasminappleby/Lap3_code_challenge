# Lap 3 Code Challenge

## To run the project

- Clone this repo 
- Open in VSCode and open the Terminal
- Use `npm run dev` 
- If your browser does not open automatically, go to your browser and use `http://localhost:8080/`

## Technologies Used

- React 
- Redux
- Webpack
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js

## Website Features

- You can search for any GitHub user and search for them
- Results will list every Repo they have created, and show their Open Issues, Stargazers and Forks. 

## Future Implementations
 
- Selecting a repo will show their Open Issues, Stargazers and Forks, rather than these be on the page straight away
- Better organisation of the repos on the screen, as they currently are in a line down the screen
